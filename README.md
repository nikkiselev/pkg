# PKG

TypeScript starter template for creating a Node.js package.

It uses TypeScript compiler to build modules and compiles the entire package into a single file.


## Getting Started

 1. [Use this template](https://github.com/nikkiselev/pkg/generate)
 2. Change `author`,  `repository` and `homepage` in  `package.json`.
 3.  Install dev dependencies with `npm i`

## Usage

Run the compiler in watch mode:
````
npm run dev
````

Build the project:
````
npm run build
````

Run tests:
````
npm run test
````

Prepare before publishing:
````
npm run prepare
````

## Customizing

Adjust settings in `tsconfig.json`, `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc.json` for your preferences.
